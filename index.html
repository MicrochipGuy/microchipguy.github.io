            <article>
                <p id="intro">
                    When I was 18, 19 years old, I began to build a small remote
                    controlled car. At the very beginning, it was made of Lego
                    Technic beams and axles, but time passed, and I kept upgrading
                    it. The first upgrades were mostly design upgrades: front wheel
                    drive, live rear axle (very useful to cross the small doorstep
                    of my bedroom). But as I kept acquiring hardware, the car
                    underwent deeper changes: control via Bluetooth with Arduino
                    rather than the Lego radiofrequency system, 3D printed chassis,
                    return to rear wheel drive, and rack steering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this series of articles, we will see together how I to build this
                    radio controlled car in its current state, step by step, from zero.
                </p>

                <h2 id="current-progress">Current progress</h2>

                <p>
                    At the time of writing, the car is still quite simple. It
                    features a modular chassis, made of 3D printed elements bolted
                    together. It has a mid-engine, rear wheel drive design, with a
                    live rear axle allowing it to cross small obstacles. The low
                    ground clearance allowed by the motor and the differential
                    limits obstacle size to a couple millimeters to half a
                    centimeter (1/8 to 1/5 inch), however it should be enough to
                    keep it stable while on interior use, or while crossing a
                    bedroom doorstep, or moving on irregular tiled floor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The car is moved by a Lego(-like) Power Functions small motor,
                    linked to an Arduino Uno board. To achieve this, I had to cut a
                    Lego Power Functions wire extender and wire it to a L293D dual
                    H-bridge. You can find more about this <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Notthemarsian/take-control-over-lego-power-functions-ee0bfa">here</a>.
                    The power is transmitted to the rear wheels using Lego Technic
                    beams, through a 3D-printed open rear differential. As I am
                    unable−as of today−to 3D print tyres, the car is also equipped
                    with Lego Technic wheels.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the older Lego Power Functions parts I used are
                    no longer in production. Two solutions remains: buying used
                    parts (but they will eventually run out of stock), or buying
                    clones/compatible parts. I will keep you informed from my
                    research.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the heart of the car, we find an Arduino Uno board, wired to
                    a micro-servomotor for steering, a L293D to control the main
                    motor, a HC-05 Bluetooth module to communicate, and a 9V
                    battery box (or just 9V battery, we will discuss on the
                    difference later). Unfortunately, the Bluetooth module is not
                    compatible with Apple devices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last thing is the app on the phone. Unfortunately, the HC-05
                    Bluetooth module is not compatible with Apple devices, an
                    Android smartphone is required to play with the car. The app
                    will be created using <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a>.
                    Even though it is accessible for a bunch of people, it has a
                    few downsides: it has poor to no error handling mechanisms, and
                    I had to face some bugs once the app was finished. If I am
                    motivated enough, I will show you how to code an app in Java
                    with <a href="https://libgdx.com/">libGDX</a>.

                <p>
                    The car described in this article is intended to be a toy,
                    however it is not suitable for children under 4 to 6 years
                    old (because of the small parts). An adult supervision may
                    be desirable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The car is primarily designed, and has been tested only for,
                    interior use. Take it outside at your own risks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To build the car, you will need some hardware, software, and
                    tools.

                    I would like to thank <a href="https://www.atlantique-composants.fr/">Atlantique Composants</a>, the components
                    retailer I usually source my components from, and
                    specifically the staff of their shop in Rennes, for their

                    If you are ready to begin, let's go with the first part: the

                <p>
                    Though Lego elements and parts are used throughout the project,
                    the project is neither supported nor endorsed by the Lego
                    company. Moreover, the project involves modifying and using
                    modified Lego parts. Such modifications voids any warranty on
                    Lego parts, and in no event shoud the Lego company held for
                    responsible of any possible outcome of such modifications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project comes as is, withtout any warranty. You may

                    for responsible of any possible outcome, including property
                    damage or any kind of harm. That being said, this project is
                    not something I would consider harmful or dangerous; in case of
                    property damage or harm while realising it, you really should
                    get in touch with the Guinness Book of World Records for your
